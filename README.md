# IcT Network Monitor Discord Bot
This is the JavaScript bot-end of a tool written in Rust developed by Alex6323. The Rust backend monitors the transactions per second happening on the IcT node that it is running on.  IcT is a prototype IOTA node designed for the IoT developed by the IOTA foundation.  You can follow IcT development [here](https://github.com/iotaledger/ict). You can find the Rust backend [here](https://github.com/Alex6323/ictmon).
